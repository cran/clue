\title{Miller-Nicely Consonant Phoneme Confusion Data}
\description{
  Miller-Nicely data on the auditory confusion of 16 consonant
  phonemes.
}
\usage{data("Phonemes")}
\format{
  A symmetric matrix of the misclassification probabilities of 16
  English consonant phonemes.
}
\details{
  Miller and Nicely (1955) obtained the confusions by exposing female
  subjects to a series of syllables consisting of one of the 16
  consonants followed by the vowel \samp{a} under 17 different
  experimental conditions.  The data provided are obtained from
  aggregating the six so-called flat-noise conditions in which only the
  speech-to-noise ratio was varied into a single matrix of
  misclassification frequencies.
