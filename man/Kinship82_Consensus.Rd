\title{Gordon-Vichi Kinship82 Consensus Partition Data}
\description{
  The soft (\dQuote{fuzzy}) consensus partitions for the Rosenberg-Kim
  kinship terms partition data given in Gordon and Vichi (2001).
}
\usage{data("Kinship82_Consensus")}
\format{
  A named cluster ensemble of three soft partitions of the 15 kinship
  terms into three classes.
}
\details{
  The elements of the ensemble are named \code{"MF1"}, \code{"MF2"}, and
  \code{"JMF"}, and correspond to the consensus partitions obtained by
  applying models 1, 2, and 3 in Gordon and Vichi (2001) to the kinship
  terms partition data in Rosenberg (1982), which are available as data
  set \code{\link{Kinship82}}.
