\title{Rosenberg-Kim Kinship Terms Partition Data}
\description{
  Partitions of 15 kinship terms given by 85 female undergraduates at
  Rutgers University who were asked to sort the terms into classes
  \dQuote{on the basis of some aspect of meaning}.
}
\usage{data("Kinship82")}
\format{
  A cluster ensemble of 85 hard partitions of the 15 kinship terms.
}
\details{
  Rosenberg and Kim (1975) describe an experiment where perceived
  similarities of the kinship terms were obtained from six different
  \dQuote{sorting} experiments.  These \dQuote{original} Rosenberg-Kim
  kinship terms data were published in Arabie, Carroll and de Sarbo
  (1987), and are also contained in file \file{indclus.data} in the
  shell archive \url{http://www.netlib.org/mds/indclus.shar}.

  For one of the experiments, partitions of the terms were printed in
  Rosenberg (1982).  Comparison with the original data indicates that
  the partition data have the \dQuote{nephew} and \dQuote{niece} columns
  interchanged, which is corrected in the data set at hand.
